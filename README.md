# TrueHealth : A Healthcare Website

**Problem Statement**: We are left with no option to believe on the degrees displayed in the clinics of the physician treating us because of unavailability of information. In hospital, there are no degrees on display of physicians available in such hospital. We should be vigilant about the skills of physicians before handing over our life in their hands.

**Solution**: The goal isto provide authentic information about qualificationof the physician before availing treatment from thephysician as well as protect patients from bogus physicians.
